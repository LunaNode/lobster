The WHMCS module supports integration with the WHMCS software.

Introduction
------------

Customers will be able to select products in WHMCS that will add credit to their Lobster account (or create the account if it doesn't already exist).

Lobster's WHMCS integration consists of a module for WHMCS in Lobster (i.e. this module) and a module for Lobster in WHMCS.

Installation
------------

1. Add the Lobster module for WHMCS to your WHMCS installation
	https://github.com/LunaNode/lobster-whmcs
2. Create one or more products for Lobster. For product type, use "Hosting Account". The module settings should be self-explanatory. You'll need to create a custom field "userid" which should be marked admin only.
3. MySQL table on Lobster: CREATE TABLE whmcs_tokens (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, user_id INT NOT NULL, token VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL, time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
4. Optional: remove the Make a Payment section from the dashboard
