Introduction
------------

Lobster is a simple hourly billing panel for virtual machine services.
Lobster does not manage virtual machines directly -- instead, it relies on backends that it communicates with through VM interfaces; several backends are supported.

Regions
-------

Lobster allows multiple regions to be defined.
Each region has a separate virtual machine interface, although the interface type may be the same.
Plans are shared across regions, but images are not.

Billing
-------

Lobster currently only supports a prepaid hourly billing model.
Users pay via some payment interface, and once payment is recorded as completed, credit is added to their account.
If a user is running out of credit, Lobster will send low credit notifications; once credit reaches zero, services are suspended, and eventually the account is terminated.

There are three services billed by Lobster:

* Virtual machines: have an hourly price defined in the plan
* Image storage: billed based on a configurable price per gigabyte-hour
* Bandwidth: users are given a bandwidth pool allocation in each region based on the sum of the plan bandwidth of their virtual machines. If a user uses more traffic across their VMs in some region than this allocation, they will be charged at a configurable price per gigabyte. Bandwidth is billed on a per-calendar-month basis, so usage and allocations are reset each month. Note that if a user only provisions a VM for one hour, then they will receive only a proportional allocation (the bandwidth specified in the plan is the monthly allocation).

Backends
--------

Different backends have different features, but Lobster tries to support as much as possible. Currently these backends are supported:

* OpenStack
* SolusVM

Payment gateways
----------------

Payment is generally accepted via a pay-callback system, where we direct the user to a payment gateway and then wait for a secure callback notification from the gateway that confirms payment.
Supported gateways:

* Paypal
* Coinbase
