Dependencies
------------

Lobster depends on several Golang libraries that must be fetched:

- code.google.com/p/gcfg
- github.com/asaskevich/govalidator
- github.com/fabioberger/coinbase-go
- github.com/gorilla/context
- github.com/gorilla/mux
- github.com/gorilla/schema
- github.com/gorilla/websocket
- golang.org/x/crypto
- github.com/LunaNode/gophercloud
- github.com/LunaNode/email

Run `go get` for each dependency (e.g. `go get code.google.com/p/gcfg`)

Lobster also uses noVNC for some VNC interfaces (e.g. SolusVM) where the backend does not provide its own web interface.
noVNC needs to be installed in the "novnc" subdirectory of the Lobster installation path.

Database
--------

Initialize a database using schema.sql

Configuration
-------------

Copy lobster.example.cfg to lobster.cfg and lobster.example.cfg.json to lobster.cfg.json
Both of these files need to be configured.
